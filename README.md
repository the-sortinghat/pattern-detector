## About

> μsVision - MSA Architectural Pattern and Smell Detector.

μsVision is a detection tool written in Kotlin that identifies **patterns** and **smells** within microservices
architectures. Leveraging microservices **metrics**, it analyzes and generates detailed reports about your applications.
Because it relies on metrics for analysis, this tool is technology-agnostic and does not require access to source code.

## Goals

Our primary objectives are to:

- Automate Pattern Detection: Streamline the process of identifying patterns in MSA.
- Detect Architectural Debts: Uncover architectural debts within microservices architectures.
- Enable High-Scale Analysis: Provide a tool capable of conducting large-scale analysis in MSA.

Additionally, the software assists with:

- Structured Metric Mapping: Offers a systematic method to map microservices metrics.
- Pattern and Anti-Pattern Detection: Identifies both patterns and anti-patterns.
- Architectural Debt Prioritization: Helps prioritize architectural debts effectively.

## Target Audience

μsVision is designed for various users, including:

- Software Developers
- System Administrators
- IT Managers
- IT Architects
